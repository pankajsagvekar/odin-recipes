    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular and perhaps one of the simple and tasty North Indian paneer gravy-based curry recipes. Basically, it is prepared with the combination of paneer and green peas as its hero ingredient in a tomato and onion gravy base. It is typically served with a wide range of Indian flatbread recipes like naan, roti, and poori, but can also be served with any type of rice variants too.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind onion, green chilli, ginger and garlic together in the small chutney jar of a grinder to make medium coarse paste. Grind the tomatoes to make tomato puree. Grind cashew nuts with 2 tablespoons water until smooth paste.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the same pan/kadai over medium flame. Add crushed onion paste (prepared in step-1) and salt (only for onion paste, it helps to cook onion faster). Saut√© it until oil starts to separate or it turns translucent. It will take around 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add tomato puree (prepared in step-1) and cook on medium flame until oil starts to separate, for approx. 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir and cook for a minute. Add cashew nut paste (prepared in step-1).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add boiled peas and 1/2 cup water; mix properly and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add paneer cubes and cook for 2-3 minutes. We have added plain paneer cubes but you can add shallow fried paneer to enhance the flavor</li>
        <br>
        <li>Turn off flame and transfer prepared curry to a serving bowl.</li>
